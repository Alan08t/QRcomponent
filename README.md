## My process

Hello everyone!

In this, my first project presented on this platform, I have decided to choose the first project that the platform provides us with.

So while the design is very simple, that doesn't stop me from practicing my flexbox skills, and even at the same time I can't help but be surprised at how much we can save on code with more practice.

It's amazing!

Well, for me it is a pleasure if you, dear community of this beautiful profession, can give me your opinion to learn more and more!! Thanks for reading me and my horrible English ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜….

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
